## Chicken<a name="Chicken"></a> 
Each player starts with 3 Chickens/Lives these chickens can be used at the cost of one sip of your drink,



## BUGS

1. Fixed a bug where the player could press chicken without having an active user, this would cause the entire program to crash since it was trying to access a variable that does not excist. now the player must have atleast one user input before pressing chicken.

## Additions 

1. 19/05/2022 - Check if user has a secret or not, if user does not have a secret he can not open the "Secret tab"
